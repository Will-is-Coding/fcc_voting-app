                    Ballot Box features d3js powered pie charts with interactable legends to include or disclude
                    options. A registered user can manage their poll by editing options, removing all votes, or deleting the poll.
                    All polls are shareable.

                    also add their own option to the Ballot Box. Registered users can also change their votes if they change their minds.

                <p>This is a MEAN stack project. Pie charts are created using d3.js, achieved with much effort, pain and hair pulling.
                It was a very informative project to work upon, teaching me a lesson to plan out things as best I can before starting. Though
                it is also important to realize changes will occur and making it as easy as possible to refactor is the best strategy.
