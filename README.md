# Will-is-Coding's Voting Application

This [Voting Application](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app) was the second challenge under [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com) dynamic web application projects.

## Technologies Used
This is a 
* **M**ongoDB
* **E**xpress
* **A**ngular
* **N**ode

stack developed website. 

I opted to use the powerful [d3js](https://d3js.org/) library to render the charts in my application. While it drove me to the edge
of insanity, it was a good learning experience and knowledge gained with an amazing library. 

## Requirements of freeCodeCamp

> * As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
> * As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
> * As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
> * As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
> * As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

> * As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

I've also implemented the ability to

* Manage options on created polls
* Create private polls
* Allow authenticated users to change their votes
* Allow authenticated users to change their added option
